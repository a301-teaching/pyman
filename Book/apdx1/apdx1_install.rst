There are many more libraries you can install, but Python along with NumPy, SciPy, and MatPlotLib are those that are essential for scientific programming.Working with Anaconda=====================.. index::   single: Anaconda   single: Spyder   pair: Anaconda; installing Python   pair: Spyder; installing Python   We recommend (and assume in this document) that you install the *Anaconda* Python distribution.  *Anaconda* is written, maintained, and distributed by the software company Continuum (http://www.continuum.io/).  The distribution is free to download and use, and includes essentially all of the Python libraries needed to do numerical computing.To get started, visit Youtube and view the following two 2-minute videos:* Installing Anaconda Part I: https://youtu.be/SXFtCUzokdI, which covers selecting and downloading Anaconda for Python 3.4* Installing Anaconda Part II: https://youtu.be/RZAUxrkp0XM  which covers unpacking and installationWe will be working with two different environments for creating, modifying and running python code.  The first is called Spyder, which is an integrated development environment (IDE) for Python that comes with Anaconda.  It is similar to the Matlab graphical interface, and has syntax highlighting, which colors different parts Python syntax according to function, making code easier to read.  Second, it runs a program in the background called *PyFlakes* that checks the validity of the Python syntax as you write it.  It's like a spelling and grammar checker all rolled into one, and it is extremely useful, for novice and expert alike.  The  Spyder IDE has a number of other useful features like interactive debugging, which we do not go into here, but expect you will learn about as you become more familiar with Python.The second environment is the Jupyter notebook, which will be used to present course material and class exercises.  We will demonstrate the notebook during the lab.The next step is :ref:`launching spyder` after which you can visit :ref:`install_test` to check your installed python.
